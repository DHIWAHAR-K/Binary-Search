# Binary Search in Python

## Overview

This Python script illustrates the implementation of binary search, a highly efficient searching algorithm for finding a specific element in a sorted list. The provided script includes functions for performing both iterative and recursive binary searches. Explore this script to understand the fundamental logic of binary search and its application in efficiently locating elements in a sorted collection.

## Script Components

- **Iterative Binary Search:** Implementation of binary search using an iterative approach.
- **Recursive Binary Search:** Implementation of binary search using a recursive approach.
- **User Input:** Code for user input to provide the sorted list and the target element.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the index of the target element in the sorted list.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`binary_search.py`) in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input a sorted list and the target element.
3. The script will display the index of the target element if found; otherwise, it will indicate that the element is not present.

## Customization

- Modify the script to work with different types of sorted collections (e.g., arrays, lists).
- Experiment with different sorted lists and target elements for testing the binary search algorithm.
- Adapt the script to handle specific edge cases or requirements based on your use case.
